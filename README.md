CDIF's PayPal support

### Notes to PayPal support in CDIF
Based on official [PayPal REST SDK](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-node-SDK.git), this module provides PayPal API support for CDIF. For now all PayPal API calls done through CDIF framework are sandboxed which means no real money transactions will happen. :)

To use this feature, user may need to register PayPal sandbox account and use the related account or credit card information to complete a test payment.

CDIF's PayPal device model is created based on [PayPal REST API interface](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/api)
